         <p>I had been debating getting a dog for awhile. However deciding to get one during the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic, did not make the process easy. Many of the shelters and rescues had no dogs available. However my roommate ended up finding a breeder, and we decided to each get one. We flew out to Ohio, and met with the breeder who told us that Zeus was the happiest puppy he had ever had. We drove almost 10 hours back to our apartment in Massachusetts. Zeus and I both slept for about the entire next day. I had tried to crate train him, but he was not having it, and quickly jumped into my bed.</p>

         <p class="Zeus4">In October Zeus and I went apple picking with a few of our friends. We found an apple orchard up in New Hampshire that allowed dogs. Zeus tried to eat about 20-30 apples that day. By this time Zeus had grown to about 30 lbs, and started to look much more like a teenage dog. Which came with typical teenage antics, and having fun causing trouble.</p>
